      <h2>Curiosity is not a flaw</h2>

        <h3>Curiosity = Interdisciplinarity </h3>
        <p>Post Date: <time datetime = '2026-01-03'><b>03 January,2026</time></b></p>
        <p>I wasn’t sure what I wanted to become and always thought of it as a character flaw. Everything excites me. Anything that has to do with how humans engage with the environment, and sometimes even how we use it, fascinates me. For this reason, I never quite knew what to do, but I eventually realised it was never a flaw. It was a sign that I am meant to be a data scientist.
Working with data allows you to be everywhere and nowhere at the same time, if we are being honest. In my degree, we do a lot, from mapping to modelling to decision-making, but the days I felt the most passion were the days I programmed in Python, managed and created a database for the first time, and cleaned and simulated data in Excel. Those were the moments where I was truly creating, which is ironic considering I have never been good at the creative arts, and even worse at drawing.
I know I am meant to be a data scientist because even when the work got hard, and trust me, it does, I was still happy. Happily stressed. Because I was doing what I love: being everywhere all at once.</p>
        <p>As I've come to understand my own curiostiy and indecisiveness, I realised my interests were never scattered, but were connected. </p>

      <h2>Have I ever made a real decision?</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>Free will</h3>
        <p>Post Date: <time datetime -=" 2026-01-05"><b>05 January, 2026</time></b> </p>
        <p>Theories about free will have existed for ages and have broken the minds of some of the greatest thinkers to ever grace this planet. When I speak about being “meant” to be a data scientist, I don’t mean it in a rigid or mystical sense. I mean it emotionally. I dream of being one, sometimes literally, and I genuinely love the work that comes with it. Still, I find myself wondering whether this was truly my fate, and whether any of us really have a choice at all.
The idea that I may never have made an actual decision is, to be honest, uncomfortable. But at the same time, it makes a strange kind of sense. My love for working with data isn’t something I slowly developed over time. It was there almost immediately. And I think this is true for many of us. We often can’t fully explain why we love certain things or feel drawn to specific paths. We just do.
This question reminded me of a video I recently watched that explores free will, determinism, and whether our choices are truly our own. It raises the possibility that what we experience as “choice” may simply be the most probable outcome based on everything that came before. That idea made me wonder whether we have ever made a real decision, or whether there is, metaphorically speaking, some supercomputer that determined that the most likely thing for me to love would be data science, based on patterns in my behaviour and experiences.
The thought is both fascinating and unsettling. It would be incredible, and at the same time terrifying, if our lives were the result of something like a deeply trained model running quietly in the background. I could be very far off, especially given my limited understanding of the human brain, or any brain for that matter. Perhaps we have complete free will. Or perhaps we have some degree of it, shaped and constrained by a predetermined structure. Either way, it suddenly makes sense why this question has the power to break our brains.</p>
